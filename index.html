        As a signature monument of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is ranked to be one of
        the most visited attractions in the city. Its stunning architectural design
        is a key feature of the Parisian skyline and makes for a stunning photo
        opportunity! Visitors can walk up or take an elevator ride to the first and
        second levels of the tower, from which they are greeted with a beautiful
        view of the city down below. Additionally, every night for about five

      <h4>The Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysées</h4>
      <p>
        The Champs-Elysées, a world famous Parisian avenue spanning nearly 2
        kilometers in length, is another beautiful sight that can be enjoyed from
        the City of Lights. Each day, it is visited by approximately 300,000 people
        and was even dubbed the “La Plus Belle Avenue du Monde”, or the most
        beautiful avenue in the world. It is dotted with several shops, restaurants
        and stores, and by driving down the avenue, one can also get a stunning
        head-on view of the Arc de Triomphe.

      <h4>The Louvre</h4>
      <p>
        For all the art lovers out there, this one's for you - as the world’s
        largest art museum built in 1783 with nearly 380,000 pieces of art and
        spanning more than half a million square feet in area, the Louvre is a
        historic monument in Paris and a central landmark of the city. Ranging
        from Ancient Egyptian mummies to the iconic Mona Lisa, the Louvre offers
        a wide variety of art and is filled with fascinating historical
        significance. Since it would be nearly impossible to view the whole museum
        in one day, it is a good idea to plan out or make a list of all the works
        you want to see beforehand!

  <h2>Foods to Eat</h2>
  <p>
    Calling all foodies! In addition to being a global center for art,
    architecture and fashion, Paris also offers many delicous food options, as
    cuisine is an integral aspect of Parisian culture and has played a key role
    in bringing people together. Listed below are top foods that you should be
    sure not to miss out on during your trip.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Crepes:</b> A crepe is a very thin pancake that can be filled with a variety of
        fillings, such as chocolate sauce, fresh fruit, and whipped cream. As a
        popular French food, you can try crepes at cafes or even from small
        vendors on the streets.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Macarons:</b> A classic French dessert! Macarons consist of two chewy
        almond cookies that are sandwiched around a flavorful filling. They come
        in a wide range of flavors, including hazelnut, raspberry, or pistachio.
        They can be enjoyed at local macaron cafes, my personal favorite being
        Ladurée.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Escargot:</b> Escargot is a dish of edible land snails - although seeming
        bizarre to some people at first, it is a beloved traditional French
        delicacy that is offered at many restaurants as an appetizer. They are
        often paired with herb-infused butters, such as garlic, thyme or parsley.
      </p>

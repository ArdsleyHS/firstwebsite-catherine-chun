        beautiful avenue in the world. It is dotted with several shops, restaurants
        and stores, and by driving down the avenue, one can also get a stunning

      <h4>The Louvre</h4>
      <p>
        As the world's largest art museum built in 1783 with nearly 380,000 pieces
        of art and spanning more than half a million square feet in area, the Louvre is a
        historic monument in Paris and a central landmark of the city. Ranging
        from Ancient Egyptian mummies to the iconic Mona Lisa, the Louvre offers
        a wide variety of art and is filled with fascinating historical
        significance. Since it would be nearly impossible to view the whole museum
        in one day, it is a good idea to plan out or make a list of all the works
        you want to see beforehand!
